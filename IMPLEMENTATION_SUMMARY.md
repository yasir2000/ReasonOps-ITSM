## 📈 Example Usage Scenarios

### Basic Incident Management
```python
from python_framework.core import Person, Impact, Urgency
from python_framework.practices import IncidentManagement, IncidentCategory

# Create incident management system
im = IncidentManagement()

# Create incident
incident = im.create_incident(
    "Server down",
    "Web server not responding",
    caller=Person("1", "John Doe", "john@company.com", "User", "Sales"),
    category=IncidentCategory.HARDWARE,
    impact=Impact.HIGH,
    urgency=Urgency.HIGH
)

# Process incident
incident.acknowledge(agent)
incident.resolve(technician, "Server restarted")
```

### Integrated Workflow
```python
# Create problem from multiple incidents
problem = problem_mgmt.create_problem_from_incidents(
    incident_numbers=["INC001", "INC002", "INC003"],
    short_description="Recurring server issues",
    description="Pattern of server failures needs investigation",
    category=ProblemCategory.HARDWARE,
    analyst=analyst
)

# Create change to fix problem
change = change_mgmt.create_change_request(
    short_description="Replace failing server hardware",
    description="Replace server components identified as root cause",
    justification="Prevent recurring incidents",
    category=ChangeCategory.HARDWARE,
    change_type=ChangeType.NORMAL,
    requester=analyst
)
```

### Metrics and Reporting
```python
# Get comprehensive metrics
metrics = itil.get_dashboard_metrics(30)
print(f"SLA Compliance: {metrics['incident_management']['sla_compliance_rate']}%")
print(f"Change Success Rate: {metrics['change_enablement']['success_rate']}%")
print(f"Problem Resolution Rate: {metrics['problem_management']['resolution_rate']}%")
```
