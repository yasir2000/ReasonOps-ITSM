# Change Enablement Practice

## Purpose

To maximize the number of successful organizational changes by ensuring that risks have been properly assessed, authorizing changes to proceed, and managing the change schedule.

## Description

**Change Enablement** (previously called Change Management) ensures that all changes are assessed, authorized, prioritized, planned, tested, implemented, documented, and reviewed in a controlled manner.

The practice encompasses:
- **Change Authority**: Decision-making for change authorization
- **Change Schedule**: Coordinated planning of all changes
- **Change Assessment**: Risk and impact evaluation
- **Change Types**: Different approaches for different change categories

## Key Concepts

### What is a Change?
The addition, modification, or removal of anything that could have a direct or indirect effect on services.

### Change Types

#### 1. Standard Changes
- **Pre-approved**: Low risk, well-understood procedure
- **No CAB Review**: Follow established procedure
- **Examples**: Password resets, standard software installations, routine maintenance

#### 2. Normal Changes  
- **CAB Assessment**: Require Change Advisory Board review
- **Risk Assessment**: Formal impact and risk analysis
- **Examples**: Major system upgrades, new service deployments, infrastructure changes

#### 3. Emergency Changes
- **Fast Track**: Urgent changes to resolve critical issues
- **Post-Implementation Review**: Reviewed after implementation
- **Examples**: Security patches, critical bug fixes, service restoration changes

## Change Enablement Model

```
Change           Change          Change         Change         Change
Request     →    Assessment  →   Authorization → Planning  →   Implementation
    ↓               ↓               ↓              ↓               ↓
Originator      Impact/Risk     Change          Detailed        Controlled
Submits         Analysis        Authority       Schedule        Deployment
Request         Evaluation      Decision        Coordination    Monitoring
```

```
Change           Change          Change         Post-Implementation
Testing     →    Deployment  →   Review    →    Closure
    ↓               ↓               ↓              ↓
Validate        Execute         Evaluate        Document
Solution        Change          Success         Lessons
Verify          Monitor         Capture         Close
Impact          Progress        Learning        Records
```

## Change Authority

### Change Authority Structure

#### Emergency Change Advisory Board (ECAB)
- **Purpose**: Rapid decision-making for emergency changes
- **Members**: Subset of CAB available 24/7
- **Decisions**: Emergency changes only
- **Timeline**: Minutes to hours

#### Change Advisory Board (CAB)
- **Purpose**: Assess and authorize normal changes
- **Members**: Cross-functional representation
- **Decisions**: Normal changes requiring assessment
- **Timeline**: Days to weeks

#### Change Manager
- **Purpose**: Day-to-day change administration
- **Authority**: Standard changes, change process management
- **Decisions**: Administrative and procedural
- **Timeline**: Immediate to days

### CAB Membership
**Core Members (Always Present):**
- Change Manager (Chair)
- Technical Representatives (Infrastructure, Applications, Security)
- Business Representatives
- Customer Representatives
- Supplier Representatives (if applicable)

**Extended Members (As Needed):**
- Subject Matter Experts
- Project Managers
- Risk and Compliance Representatives
- Finance Representatives

## Change Assessment

### Impact Assessment
Evaluation of potential effects on:
- **Services**: Availability, performance, functionality
- **Users**: Number affected, business processes impacted
- **Technology**: Systems, applications, infrastructure
- **Organization**: People, processes, costs

### Risk Assessment
Analysis of potential negative outcomes:
- **Technical Risks**: Implementation failure, rollback needs
- **Business Risks**: Service disruption, data loss
- **Security Risks**: Vulnerabilities, access control
- **Compliance Risks**: Regulatory, policy violations

### Assessment Criteria
```
Risk Level = Probability × Impact

Probability Levels:
- High (3): Very likely to occur (>70%)
- Medium (2): May occur (30-70%)  
- Low (1): Unlikely to occur (<30%)

Impact Levels:
- High (3): Significant business impact
- Medium (2): Moderate business impact
- Low (1): Minor business impact

Risk Score = Probability × Impact
- High Risk: 6-9 points
- Medium Risk: 3-4 points
- Low Risk: 1-2 points
```
