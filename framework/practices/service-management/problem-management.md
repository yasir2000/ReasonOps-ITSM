# Problem Management Practice

## Purpose

To reduce the likelihood and impact of incidents by identifying actual and potential causes of incidents and managing workarounds and known errors.

## Description

**Problem Management** involves activities to identify and manage the causes of incidents and potential incidents. A **problem** is a cause, or potential cause, of one or more incidents.

The practice includes:
- **Reactive Problem Management**: Triggered by one or more incidents
- **Proactive Problem Management**: Identifies problems before incidents occur

## Key Concepts

### Problem vs. Incident
- **Incident**: "Something is broken" - focus on restoration
- **Problem**: "Why did it break?" - focus on root cause

### Known Error
- A problem that has been analyzed but not resolved
- Workaround may be available
- Tracked in Known Error Database (KEDB)

### Workaround
- Technique to restore service or reduce impact
- Temporary solution until permanent fix is available
- May become permanent if cost-effective

## Process Flow

```
Problem          Problem          Problem         Root Cause      Known Error
Identification → Investigation → Diagnosis   →   Analysis    →   Record
      ↓              ↓               ↓              ↓              ↓
  Incident       Information     Symptoms      True Cause     Workaround
  Analysis       Gathering       Analysis      Identified     Development
  Monitoring     System Logs     Testing       Investigation  Documentation
  Trend          Interviews      Replication   Analysis       Knowledge Base
```

```

Development  →   Control       →   Closure    →    Closure
     ↓               ↓               ↓              ↓

```

## Problem Categories

### Reactive Problems (60-80% of problems)
**Triggered by:**
- Single major incident
- Multiple related incidents
- Pattern of recurring incidents
- Trend analysis findings

**Examples:**
- Server crashes causing multiple outages

- Network performance degradation
- Security vulnerability exploitation

### Proactive Problems (20-40% of problems)
**Identified through:**
- Technical monitoring and alerting
- System performance analysis

|---------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| High | High | P1 (Critical) | 24-48 hours |
| High | Medium | P2 (High) | 1-2 weeks |
| High | Low | P3 (Medium) | 2-4 weeks |
| Medium | High | P2 (High) | 1-2 weeks |
| Medium | Medium | P3 (Medium) | 2-4 weeks |
| Medium | Low | P4 (Low) | 1-3 months |
| Low | High | P3 (Medium) | 2-4 weeks |
| Low | Medium | P4 (Low) | 1-3 months |
| Low | Low | P4 (Low) | As resources allow |

### Frequency Definitions
- **High**: Daily occurrences or major incidents
- **Medium**: Weekly occurrences or moderate incidents  
- **Low**: Monthly occurrences or minor incidents

### Business Impact Definitions
- **High**: Critical business processes affected, revenue impact
- **Medium**: Important business processes affected, productivity impact
- **Low**: Minor business processes affected, minimal impact

## Root Cause Analysis Techniques

### 1. 5 Whys Technique
Simple technique asking "why" five times to drill down to root cause.

**Example:**
1. Why did the application crash? - Memory was exceeded
2. Why was memory exceeded? - Memory leak in the code
3. Why was there a memory leak? - Objects not properly released
4. Why weren't objects released? - Missing cleanup code
5. Why was cleanup code missing? - Code review didn't catch it

### 2. Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram
Visual technique categorizing potential causes:
- **People**: Skills, training, procedures
- **Process**: Methods, policies, workflows  
- **Technology**: Hardware, software, infrastructure
- **Environment**: Physical, organizational, external factors

### 3. Timeline Analysis
Chronological analysis of events leading to the problem:
- Create detailed timeline of incidents
- Identify patterns and correlations
- Map to system changes and activities
- Identify trigger events and contributing factors

### 4. Fault Tree Analysis
Logical breakdown of how failures can occur:
- Start with top-level failure event
- Break down into potential immediate causes
- Continue breaking down until root causes identified
- Identify single points of failure
