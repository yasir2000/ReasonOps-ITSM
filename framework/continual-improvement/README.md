# Continual Improvement Framework

## Overview

Continual Improvement is embedded throughout the ITIL Service Value System to ensure that organizations are constantly enhancing their services, processes, and overall performance to deliver increased value to stakeholders.

## Continual Improvement Definition

**Continual Improvement** is a recurring organizational activity performed at all levels to ensure that an organization's performance continually meets stakeholder expectations.

### Key Principles
- **Improvement is everyone's responsibility** - Not limited to specific roles
- **Focus on value creation** - All improvements should deliver stakeholder value
- **Start small and build momentum** - Begin with manageable improvements
- **Measure everything** - Use data to drive improvement decisions
- **Collaborate across boundaries** - Break down silos for holistic improvement

## Continual Improvement Model

The ITIL 4 Continual Improvement Model provides a structured approach to improvement:
