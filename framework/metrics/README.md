# ITIL 4 Metrics and Measurement Framework

## Overview

Measurement is fundamental to the ITIL Service Value System, enabling organizations to understand current performance, identify improvement opportunities, and demonstrate value delivery to stakeholders.

## Measurement Principles

### ITIL 4 Measurement Approach
