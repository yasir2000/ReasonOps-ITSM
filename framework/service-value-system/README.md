- Optimize for the whole, not parts

**Practical Application:**
- End-to-end service design
- Impact assessment
- Integration planning
- Systems thinking

### 1.6 Keep It Simple and Practical
- Use minimum viable processes
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Make it useful for practitioners
- Focus on practical outcomes

**Practical Application:**
- Process simplification

- Technology enablement

## 2. Governance

Governance ensures the organization is directed and controlled effectively:

### 2.1 Governance Activities
- **Evaluate** - Assess performance and conformance
- **Direct** - Set direction and priorities
- **Monitor** - Track progress and outcomes

### 2.2 Governance Structure
- **Governing Body** - Ultimate authority and accountability
- **Governance Framework** - Policies, processes, and procedures
- **Governance Mechanisms** - Controls, measurements, and reporting

### 2.3 Key Governance Areas
- Strategy and planning
- Portfolio management
- Risk management
- Resource management
- Performance management
- Compliance management

## 3. Service Value Chain

The Service Value Chain is the central element of the SVS:

### 3.1 Value Chain Activities

#### Plan
- **Purpose**: Ensure shared understanding of vision, status, and improvement direction
- **Key Inputs**: Policies, requirements, strategic direction
- **Key Outputs**: Strategic plans, tactical plans, portfolio decisions

#### Engage
- **Purpose**: Provide good understanding of stakeholder needs and transparency
- **Key Inputs**: Service portfolio, market opportunities, user requirements
- **Key Outputs**: Requirements, feedback, contracts, reports

#### Design & Transition
- **Purpose**: Ensure services meet stakeholder expectations for quality and value
- **Key Inputs**: Requirements, specifications, policies
- **Key Outputs**: Service designs, transition plans, change requests

#### Obtain/Build
- **Purpose**: Ensure service components are available when needed
- **Key Inputs**: Designs, requirements, specifications
- **Key Outputs**: Service components, software, infrastructure

#### Deliver & Support
- **Purpose**: Ensure services are delivered and supported according to agreed specifications
- **Key Inputs**: Services, service requests, incidents
- **Key Outputs**: Delivered services, service performance information

#### Improve
- **Purpose**: Ensure continual improvement across all activities
- **Key Inputs**: Performance information, improvement ideas, feedback
- **Key Outputs**: Improvement initiatives, plans, reports

### 3.2 Value Streams

Value streams are specific combinations of value chain activities designed to respond to particular scenarios.

**Example Value Stream: New Service Development**
1. **Plan** → Define service strategy and requirements
2. **Engage** → Gather stakeholder requirements and feedback
3. **Design & Transition** → Design service and transition plan
4. **Obtain/Build** → Develop and configure service components
5. **Deliver & Support** → Deploy and operate the service
6. **Improve** → Monitor and enhance service performance

## 4. Four Dimensions

All aspects of service management must consider four dimensions:

### 4.1 Organizations and People
- Organizational structure and culture
- Roles and responsibilities
- Competencies and skills
- Leadership and management
- Communication and collaboration

### 4.2 Information and Technology
- Information architecture and management
- Data and knowledge management
- Technology architecture
- Development methods and tools
- Security and compliance

### 4.3 Partners and Suppliers
- Service integration and management
- Supplier relationships
- Contracts and agreements
- Service ecosystem
- Partner capabilities

### 4.4 Value Streams and Processes
- Value stream design
- Process optimization
- Workflow management
- Performance measurement
- Continual improvement

## 5. Continual Improvement

Continual improvement is embedded throughout the SVS:

### 5.1 Improvement Types
- **Strategic** - Long-term, fundamental changes
- **Tactical** - Medium-term improvements
- **Operational** - Day-to-day optimizations

### 5.2 Improvement Model
1. **What is the vision?** - Define improvement direction
2. **Where are we now?** - Assess current state
3. **Where do we want to be?** - Define target state
4. **How do we get there?** - Plan improvement journey
5. **Take action** - Execute improvement initiatives
6. **Did we get there?** - Evaluate results
7. **How do we keep momentum going?** - Sustain improvements
