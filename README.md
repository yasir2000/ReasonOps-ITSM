## üöÄ SDK Quickstart

Use the Python SDK to interact with ReasonOps ITSM programmatically (dashboards, monthly summaries, SLM metrics, and financial operations).

Example:

```python
from reasonops_sdk import ReasonOpsClient

client = ReasonOpsClient()

# Fetch integrated dashboard
dashboard = client.get_dashboard()
print(dashboard.services, dashboard.offerings)

# Compute SLM metrics for last 30 days
metrics = client.compute_slm_metrics(period_days=30)
print(metrics.availability_pct, metrics.mttr_minutes, metrics.mtbf_hours)

# Export monthly summary (auto-detected current month) to a file
summary = client.export_monthly_summary(out_file="artifacts/monthly_summary.json")
print(summary.month, summary.penalties.keys())
```

Notes:
- The SDK expects the underlying framework modules (e.g., `integration/orchestrator.py`) to be available in the Python path when executing.
- If you‚Äôre running directly from this repository, run Python from the repo root so relative imports work.

## üì¶ Build and Publish the SDK

### Build locally

```bash
# Ensure build tooling is installed
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install build

# Build wheel and sdist into ./dist
python -m build
```

### Run tests locally

```bash
pip install pytest
python -m pytest -q
```

### GitHub Actions CI

This repo includes `.github/workflows/sdk-ci.yml` which:
- Runs tests on push/PR
- Builds distribution artifacts and uploads them as workflow artifacts
- Optionally publishes to PyPI when a GitHub Release is published and `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret is set

To publish via GitHub Actions:
1. Add repository secret `PYPI_API_TOKEN` (a PyPI API token).
2. Create a GitHub Release (tag should match the desired version in `pyproject.toml`).

## üéØ Repository Purpose

## üñ•Ô∏è Run the ReasonOps Web App + API

Backend API (FastAPI):

```bash
# From repo root
"C:/Program Files/Python311/python.exe" -m pip install -r api/requirements.txt
"C:/Program Files/Python311/python.exe" -m uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Frontend (Vite + React + TS):

```bash
cd webapp
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173
```

Notes:
- Dev proxy is configured in `webapp/vite.config.ts` to forward `/api` to `http://localhost:8000`.
- If you deploy the API elsewhere, set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to that origin.
- The UI has a built-in mock fallback for all endpoints if the API is temporarily unavailable (see `src/services/mock.ts`).

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, here's an explanation of the history and evolution of ITIL from its inception in the 1980s to the current ITIL 4 version:

ITIL was first developed in the late 1980s by the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA), a former British government agency. The initial version was a collection of best practices for managing IT services, primarily focused on improving efficiency and reducing costs.

ITIL v1:

\- Released in the late 1980s

\- Consisted of a library of 31 books covering various aspects of IT service management

\- Provided guidance on areas like service support, service delivery, software management, and security management

ITIL v2:

\- Released in 2000-2004

\- Consolidated and restructured the previous 31 books into 9 logically structured sets

\- Introduced the concept of service lifecycle, which included service strategy, service design, service transition, service operation, and continual service improvement

ITIL v3:

\- Released in 2007

\- Built upon the service lifecycle approach introduced in ITIL v2

\- Added new guidance on topics like service strategy, service design, and continual service improvement

\- Emphasized the importance of aligning IT services with business needs

ITIL 2011 Edition:

\- An update to ITIL v3, released in 2011

\- Incorporated minor updates and improvements based on feedback from users

ITIL 4:

\- Released in 2019

\- Represents a significant evolution from previous versions

\- Introduces the service value system, a holistic operating model for service management

\- Focuses on value co-creation with customers and stakeholders

\- Integrates modern practices like Agile, DevOps, and Lean principles

\- Emphasizes flexibility and adaptability to changing business environments

Throughout its evolution, ITIL has remained a widely adopted framework for IT service management, helping organizations improve service quality, increase efficiency, and better align IT services with business goals. Each new version has built upon the foundations of the previous versions while incorporating updates and enhancements to reflect the changing IT landscape and business requirements.

**Service Support in ITIL**

Ongoing support to customers and end users 

The service support area in ITIL covers the following key processes:

1\. **Service Desk:** The service desk is the single point of contact for users to **report incidents, request services, or seek assistance related to IT services**. It plays a crucial role in managing user interactions and providing efficient support.

2\. **Incident Management**: Incident management is the process of **restoring normal service operation as quickly as possible after an incident occurs**. It involves recording, classifying, investigating, diagnosing, and resolving incidents, as well as communicating status updates to users.

3\. **Problem Management**: Problem management aims to **identify the root causes of incidents and implement permanent solutions to prevent recurring issues**. It involves analyzing incident data, identifying trends, and proactively managing problems to minimize their impact on IT services.

4\. **Request Fulfillment**: Request fulfillment is the process of handling service requests from users, such as requests for new hardware, software installations, or access permissions. It ensures that requests are properly evaluated, approved, and fulfilled in a timely and efficient manner.

5\. **Access Management**: Access management is responsible for granting authorized users the right to access specific IT services, data, or resources while restricting access to unauthorized users. It involves managing user identities, access rights, and access controls.

6\. **Event Management:** **Event management is the process of monitoring and responding to events that occur in the IT infrastructure.** It involves detecting, analyzing, and determining the appropriate actions to take in response to events, such as alerts, notifications, or system messages.

SERVICE Delivery

In ITIL, service delivery refers to the set of practices and processes that are focused on the design, creation, and deployment of IT services to meet the needs and requirements of customers and users. The service delivery area in ITIL covers the following key processes:

1\. Service Level Management:

Service level management is the process of defining, negotiating, monitoring, and reporting on **service level agreements (SLAs)** **and operational level agreements (OLAs).** It ensures that the agreed-upon service levels are met and maintained.

- SLAs are external agreements between the service provider and the customer, focused on service quality commitments.
- OLAs are internal agreements within the service provider organization, focused on the operational processes and interdependencies required to deliver the service defined in the SLA.

2\. Service Catalog Management:

Service catalog management is the process of maintaining and managing a central repository of available IT services, including their descriptions, pricing, and associated service level agreements.

3\. Capacity Management:

Capacity management is the process of ensuring that the IT infrastructure and resources have sufficient capacity to meet current and future service delivery requirements. It involves monitoring, analyzing, and adjusting capacity to meet the changing demands.

4\. Availability Management:

Availability management is the process of ensuring that IT services and supporting components are available and accessible when needed by users and customers. It involves monitoring, analyzing, and improving the availability of IT services.

5\. IT Service Continuity Management:

IT service continuity management is the process of managing risks and ensuring the continuity of IT services in the event of disruptions or disasters. It involves developing and implementing continuity plans and recovery strategies.

6\. Information Security Management:

Information security management is the process of ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and data assets. It involves implementing and maintaining appropriate security controls and policies.

7\. Supplier Management:

Supplier management is the process of managing and coordinating the delivery of services from external suppliers or vendors. It includes negotiating contracts, monitoring supplier performance, and ensuring adherence to agreed-upon service levels.

The service delivery processes in ITIL are crucial for designing, implementing, and managing IT services that meet the needs and expectations of customers and users. They ensure that services are delivered consistently, reliably, and with appropriate levels of quality, security, and continuity.

Sure, here's an explanation of software management and security management in ITIL:

Software Management:

Software management refers to the processes and practices involved in managing the lifecycle of software applications within an organization. In ITIL, software management covers the following key areas:

1\. Software Asset Management: This process involves managing and controlling software assets throughout their lifecycle, including procurement, deployment, updates, and retirement. It ensures that software assets are accounted for, licensed, and properly utilized.

2\. Software Control and Distribution: This process focuses on the controlled distribution and installation of software across the organization. It includes activities such as software packaging, testing, and deployment to ensure that software is delivered and installed correctly.

3\. Software Development and Maintenance: This area covers the processes and practices related to the development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. It includes activities such as requirements gathering, coding, testing, and bug fixing.

Sure, I'll explain the service lifecycle concept in ITIL in a way that an entry-level software engineer can understand.


Imagine you're part of a team that develops and maintains a software application for a company. This application is a service that the company provides to its customers or employees. The service lifecycle in ITIL describes the different stages that this service goes through, from its initial conception to its ongoing operation and improvement.

1\. Service Strategy:

Before you even start developing the application, the company needs to have a strategy in place. This strategy defines the purpose of the service, the target customers, and how it aligns with the company's overall business goals. It's like creating a blueprint or a high-level plan for the service.

2\. Service Design:

Once the strategy is defined, the next step is to design the service. In this stage, you and your team would gather requirements, design the architecture, and plan out how the application will be developed, tested, and deployed. You'll also consider factors like scalability, security, and how the service will be maintained and supported.

3\. Service Transition:

After the design phase, it's time to actually build and transition the service into a live environment. This stage involves activities like coding, testing, and deploying the application to production servers. It also includes training and documentation for those who will be using and supporting the service.

4\. Service Operation:

Once the application is live, the focus shifts to operating and maintaining the service. This stage involves activities like monitoring the application's performance, handling incidents and requests from users, and performing routine maintenance tasks.

5\. Continual Service Improvement:

As the application is being used, you'll gather feedback and data on its performance, user experience, and any issues that arise. The continual service improvement stage involves analyzing this information and identifying areas for improvement. This could lead to updates, bug fixes, or even new features being developed, and the cycle repeats with a new iteration of the service lifecycle.

The service lifecycle in ITIL provides a structured approach to managing services from start to finish. It ensures that services are designed, built, and operated in a way that aligns with business needs and provides value to customers or users. As a software engineer, understanding this lifecycle can help you see how your work fits into the bigger picture of delivering and maintaining high-quality IT services.

Sure, I'll explain these ITIL 4 concepts related to the service value system using examples that an entry-level software engineer can understand.

The service value system is a holistic operating model for service management introduced in ITIL 4. It represents a shift from a linear, process-based approach to a more flexible and integrated model that emphasizes value co-creation with customers and stakeholders.

Imagine you're part of a software development team working on a new mobile application for a retail company. The service value system provides a framework for how your team can collaborate with the company and its customers to deliver a valuable service.

1\. Focuses on value co-creation with customers and stakeholders:

`   `- Instead of just building an app based on predefined requirements, your team actively involves the company's stakeholders (product managers, marketing, etc.) and potential customers throughout the development process.

`   `- You gather feedback, incorporate suggestions, and continuously refine the app to ensure it provides value to the customers and aligns with the company's goals.

`   `- It's a collaborative effort where the customers and stakeholders are not just passive recipients but active participants in shaping the service.

2\. Integrates modern practices like Agile, DevOps, and Lean principles:

`   `- Your team follows an Agile development methodology, with frequent iterations and continuous feedback loops.

`   `- You adopt DevOps practices, automating the build, testing, and deployment processes for faster and more reliable releases.

`   `- You apply Lean principles, focusing on minimizing waste and maximizing value delivery.

`   `- These modern practices help your team be more responsive, efficient, and aligned with the service value system's emphasis on continuous improvement and value co-creation.

3\. Emphasizes flexibility and adaptability to changing business environments:

`   `- As customer needs and market trends evolve, your team can quickly adapt and iterate on the app's features and functionality.

`   `- The service value system encourages a flexible mindset, where you can pivot and adjust your approach based on changing business environments or customer feedback.

`   `- Instead of being constrained by rigid processes, your team has the agility to respond to new opportunities or challenges, ensuring the app remains valuable and relevant.

By adopting the service value system mindset, your software development team becomes a true partner in delivering value to the customers and the business. It's a collaborative, iterative, and adaptive approach that leverages modern practices to ensure the service (in this case, the mobile app) continuously meets the evolving needs of its users and stakeholders.

As an entry-level software engineer, you would be involved in the entire lifecycle of the app, from conception to operation and continuous improvement. Here's how the service value system would influence your work:

1\.	Understanding the value proposition: Before writing any code, you and your team would work closely with the company's stakeholders (product managers, marketing, customer support, etc.) to understand the value proposition of the app. What problems is it trying to solve? What needs does it address for customers and drivers?

2\.	Collaborative design and development: Instead of working in silos, your team would collaborate with stakeholders throughout the design and development process. You would gather feedback from potential users, iterate on features, and ensure that the app is being built to deliver value to customers and the business.

3\.	Embracing modern practices: To be more efficient and responsive, your team would adopt modern practices like Agile methodologies, DevOps principles, and Lean thinking. This could involve practices like continuous integration, automated testing, and frequent releases to quickly deliver value and incorporate feedback.

4\.	Focusing on the end-to-end service: Rather than just building the app, you would consider the entire service experience, from how users discover and onboard to how the app integrates with backend systems and support processes. Your role extends beyond just writing code to ensuring the overall service delivers value.

Continuous improvement: Once the app is released, your team would monitor its performance, gather user feedback, and continuously improve and update the app based on changing needs and market conditions. It's an ongoing cycle of value co-creation and optimization.

Key components of the service value system

Imagine a factory that takes raw materials (opportunities and demands) and turns them into finished products (valuable services) for customers. The service value system in ITIL is like that factory, with different parts working together to create value. Here's a breakdown of the key components for an entry-level software professional:

1. **Guiding Principles:** These are basically the golden rules that everyone in the "factory" follows. They focus on things like always delivering value to the customer and working together effectively.
1. **Governance:** This is the management team that oversees the whole operation. They make sure the factory runs smoothly and everyone is following the rules.
1. **Service Value Chain:** This is the step-by-step process of taking an idea and turning it into a working service. As a software professional, you'll likely be involved in some of these steps, like design, development, and support.
1. **Practices:** Think of these as the tools and techniques used throughout the factory. There are many ITIL practices, but some relevant to you might be things like configuration management (keeping track of software versions) or incident management (fixing problems).
1. **Continual Improvement:** The factory never stops getting better! This part focuses on always looking for ways to improve the efficiency and quality of the services produced. As a software developer, you might be involved in suggesting improvements to the development process.

Essentially, these components work together to ensure the IT services you help create deliver value to the business and its customers

L1/L2/L3 ‚Äì Explained 

**Imagine a Pit Crew for Your Software Issues**

Think of your software and its users as a race car. When problems arise (bugs, errors), you have a team to fix them, just like a pit crew. This team is often organized into different levels (L1, L2, L3) based on their expertise and the complexity of issues they handle.

**Delivery Layers: Your Pit Crew's Expertise**

- **L1 (Level 1):** These are the first responders, like the jack crew in a pit stop. They handle common, well-defined problems that often have quick solutions. They might reset configurations, restart services, or provide basic troubleshooting steps.
- **L2 (Level 2):** They're the more experienced technicians, like the tire changers. They tackle issues that require deeper investigation or go beyond basic troubleshooting. L2 engineers might analyze logs, diagnose root causes, or implement workarounds.
- **L3 (Level 3):** These are the pit crew's experts, like the engine specialists. They deal with intricate problems requiring advanced knowledge or specialized skills. L3 engineers might fix complex bugs, perform in-depth debugging, or involve developers in resolving coding issues.

**OLAs: The Pit Stop Playbook**

OLAs (Operational Level Agreements) are like the pit crew's playbook. They define:

- **Handoff Times:** How long should L1 try to resolve an issue before escalating it to L2? How long should L2 work on it before involving L3? These timeframes ensure timely resolution and prevent issues from getting stuck at a single level.
- **Responsibility Levels:** What types of problems are L1, L2, and L3 expected to handle? This avoids confusion and ensures the right expertise is applied to each issue.
- **Communication Protocols:** How should issues be communicated between levels? This could involve ticketing systems, escalation procedures, or specific communication tools.

Remember, these principles are meant to be flexible and adaptable. As you gain experience, you'll learn how to best apply them in your specific role.

The four dimensions of service management, introduced in ITIL 4, provide a holistic view of how to create and deliver valuable services. They emphasize that successful service management requires considering all these aspects, not just individual parts. Here's a breakdown of each dimension:

**1. Organizations and People:**

- This dimension focuses on the human element. It encompasses: 
  - **Organizational structures and management styles:** How your company is organized and how teams collaborate.
  - **Roles and responsibilities:** Who does what within the service management system.
  - **Capacity and competencies:** Ensuring your team has the skills and knowledge to deliver services effectively.
  - **Communication and collaboration tools:** The systems and methods used for information sharing and teamwork.

**2. Information and Technology:**

- This dimension deals with the information and technology that support service delivery. It includes: 
  - **Information management:** How you create, store, access, and use information effectively.
  - **Knowledge management:** Capturing, sharing, and applying knowledge within the organization.
  - **Technology and information security:** Protecting your data and systems from threats.
  - **Infrastructure, applications, and data:** The technological foundation for your services.

**3. Partners and Suppliers:**

- This dimension recognizes that you may not do everything yourself. It includes: 
  - **Relationships with external vendors and suppliers:** How you collaborate with third parties who provide services or technology.
  - **Managing contracts and service level agreements (SLAs):** Ensuring you get the agreed-upon value from your partners.

**4. Value Streams and Processes:**

- This dimension focuses on how you actually deliver value to your customers. It includes: 
  - **Value streams:** The series of steps that create and deliver products and services.
  - **Processes:** The specific activities and decisions within a value stream.
  - **Continual service improvement (CSI):** Always looking for ways to improve your services.

By considering all four dimensions, you can create a well-rounded service management system that delivers value to your customers and stakeholders. Each dimension interacts with the others. For instance, effective communication (Organizations and People) is crucial for managing relationships with partners (Partners and Suppliers).

Imagine these four dimensions as ingredients in a recipe. You wouldn't just use flour and water to bake a cake, would you? You'd need all the ingredients working together to create a delicious dessert. Similarly, successful service management requires a balanced focus on all four dimensions.

In the world of IT service management, you'll encounter three key terms that deal with different types of interactions: incidents, requests, and service catalog tasks (SCTasks). Here's a breakdown for an entry-level software engineer:

**1. Incident:**

- Imagine an **unexpected disruption** to a service or a reduction in its quality. It's like hitting a bump in the road while using an app. The app might crash, or a critical feature might stop working.
- **Your role:** If you encounter an incident (maybe a bug in your code), you'd try to fix it or find a workaround to restore normal service as quickly as possible. You might also document the incident to help identify the root cause and prevent future occurrences.

**2. Request:**

- Think of a request as a **standard service or piece of information** a user needs. It's like a smooth stretch of road where users ask for help with everyday tasks. This could be resetting a password, requesting access to a specific software program, or asking for help with a basic printer setup.
- **Your role:** You might not be directly involved in fulfilling all requests, but understanding them helps prioritize your work. For instance, a request to reset a password might be less urgent than fixing a critical bug you identified.

**3. Service Catalog Task (SCTask):**

- An SCTask is a specific **pre-defined service offering** listed in a catalog. Think of it like a menu at a restaurant; each item is a service you can order. An SCTask could be installing a new software program, configuring a user account, or moving data to a new server.
- **Your role:** You might be involved in fulfilling SCTasks by following documented procedures. For instance, if an SCTask involves installing a new software program, you might have a step-by-step guide to follow to ensure it's done correctly.

Here's a table to summarize the key differences:

|Term|Description|Example|Your Role|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|Incident|Unexpected disruption to a service|App crashes, critical feature stops working|Fix the issue, find a workaround, document the incident|
|Request|Standard service or information needed|Reset password, request software access, printer setup help|May not be directly involved, but understanding helps prioritize work|
|Service Catalog Task (SCTask)|Pre-defined service offering|Installing software, configuring accounts, moving data|Fulfill the SCTask by following documented procedures|

Remember, these are different types of interactions within the IT service management system. Understanding them helps you categorize issues and prioritize your work effectively.

- **Your role:** While senior engineers might handle the nitty-gritty of deployment, you might be involved in testing deployments in smaller environments before they go live.

**2. Software Development and Management (SDM):**

- Think of this as the broader process of creating and maintaining high-quality software. It's like the entire recipe for your dish, from choosing ingredients to perfecting the cooking process. SDM encompasses: 
  - **Software development lifecycle (SDLC):** The defined stages your code goes through, from planning and design to coding, testing, and deployment.
  - **Version control:** Using tools like Git to track changes to your code, allowing for collaboration and easy rollbacks if needed.
  - **Coding standards and best practices:** Following established guidelines to ensure your code is clean, maintainable, and secure.
- **Your role:** You'll be heavily involved in SDM by writing code according to best practices, using version control tools effectively, and following the defined development process.

**3. Infrastructure and Platform Management:**

- Imagine this as the foundation for your software, like the pots, pans, and oven needed to cook your dish. It involves: 
  - **Servers:** The computers that run your software.
  - **Databases:** Where your software stores its data.
  - **Networks:** How the different parts of your software system communicate with each other.
  - **Cloud platforms:** Services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure that provide infrastructure and platform resources on demand.
- **Your role:** You might not be directly managing servers or databases as an entry-level engineer, but understanding these components helps you appreciate how your code interacts with the bigger system.

By understanding these technical management practices, you'll gain a broader perspective on the software development lifecycle. You'll see how your code fits into the bigger picture and how it's ultimately delivered to users in a smooth and efficient manner.

## Understanding REQ, RITM, and SCTASK in ServiceNow

**REQ (Request)**, **RITM (Request Item Task)**, and **SCTASK (Service Catalog Task)** are key concepts within the ServiceNow platform that are used to manage and track various types of requests.

### REQ: The Parent Request

* A REQ is the overarching request that encompasses the entire service request or incident. It provides a central point for tracking and managing all related tasks and activities.
* When a user submits a request for a new service, change, or support, a REQ is created.

### RITM: Request Item Task

* An RITM is a sub-task or activity within a REQ. It represents a specific action that needs to be performed to fulfill the request.
* RITMs are typically created automatically when a REQ is created, but they can also be created manually.
* Examples of RITMs include creating a new user account, installing software, or resolving a technical issue.

### SCTASK: Service Catalog Task

* An SCTASK is a specific task that is created as part of a service request from the Service Catalog. It represents a predefined action or workflow that is associated with a particular service.
* When a user requests a service from the Service Catalog, an SCTASK is created to track the fulfillment of that request.

**How they work together:**

1. **User submits a request:** A user submits a request through the Service Portal or other channels.
2. **REQ is created:** A REQ is created in ServiceNow to track the overall request.
3. **RITMs and SCTASKS are created:** If necessary, RITMs and SCTASKS are created within the REQ to represent specific tasks or workflows.
4. **Tasks are assigned and completed:** The assigned teams or individuals work on the RITMs and SCTASKS to fulfill the request.
5. **Request is closed:** Once all related tasks are completed and the request is fulfilled, the REQ is closed.

**In summary:**

* **REQ** is the overarching request.
* **RITM** represents a sub-task or activity within a REQ.
* **SCTASK** is a specific task associated with a service request from the Service Catalog.

By understanding these concepts, you can better manage and track service requests within ServiceNow.

**Would you like to know more about how these concepts are used in specific scenarios or how to configure them in ServiceNow?**

**Scenario: New User Onboarding**

**REQ:** A new employee joins the company and needs to be onboarded onto the company's IT systems.

**RITMs:**

* Create a new user account in the Active Directory.
* Provision access to necessary applications and systems.
* Set up the employee's email account.
* Assign the employee to appropriate security groups.
* Provide the employee with a company device and configure it.

**SCTASK (if applicable):**

* If the onboarding process involves a standardized workflow or service from the Service Catalog, an SCTASK might be created to automate or streamline certain steps.

**In this example:**

* The **REQ** is the overall request to onboard the new employee.
* The **RITMs** are the specific tasks that need to be completed to onboard the employee.
* If there's a predefined service for new user onboarding in the Service Catalog, an **SCTASK** might be created to automate some of the steps, such as creating the user account and assigning permissions.

**By breaking down the onboarding process into smaller, manageable tasks (RITMs), it becomes easier to track progress, assign responsibilities, and ensure that all necessary steps are completed.**

## Understanding SLAs, OLAs, SLIs, and KPIs

These acronyms are commonly used in IT service management to define and measure service quality. 

### Service Level Agreement (SLA)
An SLA is a formal agreement between a service provider and a customer that outlines the specific service levels that the provider commits to deliver. It includes metrics, penalties, and remedies for service failures.

**Example:** An SLA for a web hosting service might guarantee 99.9% uptime.

### Operational Level Agreement (OLA)
An OLA is an internal agreement between different teams within an organization to define the level of service that one team will provide to another. It's often used to coordinate efforts and ensure smooth operations.

**Example:** An OLA between the IT operations team and the development team could define the expected response time for resolving production issues.

### Service Level Indicator (SLI)
An SLI is a metric used to measure the performance of a specific service. It helps track how well a service is meeting its objectives.

**Example:** For a web application, SLIs might include:
* Uptime percentage
* Response time
* Error rate

### Key Performance Indicator (KPI)
A KPI is a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively a company is achieving its key objectives. KPIs can be used to measure various aspects of business performance, including financial performance, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

**Example:** For an IT team, KPIs might include:
* Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)
* Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
* Customer satisfaction ratings

**Relationship between these terms:**

SLIs measure the performance of a service. SLOs define the target performance levels for SLIs. SLAs are agreements that define the SLAs and SLOs that a service provider commits to. OLAs are internal agreements between teams that support the delivery of services.

By effectively managing SLAs, OLAs, SLIs, and KPIs, organizations can improve their service delivery, customer satisfaction, and overall operational efficiency.


**Service Level Objective (SLO)**

An SLO is an agreement with product stakeholders on how reliable the product is.
